# PipeAdditions
This mod add custom Pipe additions to the BC game.

This mod is a part from TMT so the same rules exept these things:

Everyone can add this to his modpack.
For Public Modpacks counts this: as long as they mention from where they got it.
Simply by adding a link to this github page is more then enough...

Another thing since this is a part of TMT you are not allowed to make custom versions and say that it is your own.

Sourcecode will come soon.
